    <h1>LEAN ON ME</h1>
<P>
    I never really wanted to go to a private university but here i stood at the gates of Arthur Jarvis university, feb,2021.
     I had previously gotten admission and started lectures at the famous university
    of calabar(UNICAL) in political science back in '19, which i kind of threw away for reasons we will not be getting into.
    As i finish clearing my documents at the gate, alongside my cousins,Ailrang and Isaac with our family friend,  <a href="./Victor.html">Victor</a>, we set 
    for the hostel to where the foundation of our intertwined fate lies.

</P>
<p>
    I couldn't be more disappointed in the environment as we walk and questioned Ailrang's sanity as he had confirmed this was a good 
    university to complete a bachelor degree. We approached the hostel and get ushered in by the porter who walks us through the disappointing rooms
    on the ground floor before leading us to  a better room of our agreement on the first floor.
</p>
<p>
    Well, i dont enjoy cleaning but i hated the dirty looking room and agreed to join the boys in cleaning. I looked up at the 
    fan and sighed. Got a rag and water to clean the dirty fan and immediately realized why it looked brown. It was rusted.
    As if my attempt wasn't fruitless enough, when the gen came on by 7pm as informed, i went to turn on the fan switch and
     the rusty fan gave us more historical
    background to its famous brown colour. It didn't rotate on the block of numbers on its rotator. I turned to face the room
    and almost silently we all guessed Wtf  we had just gotten into .
</p>
<p>
    Monday morning and i am contemplating on going or not going to the orientation exercise at the ring of the porter's bell.
    I go downstairs to meet the Godfathers, Ezekiel, Jo and Joshua who advice i go to repel the consequence that might  come
    afterwards. 
</p>
<p>
    I get to the hall and i meet the Economics HOD who bestowed upon me the crown of course rep as the chosen king i would
    eventually come to understand. Atm really, it was cuz i was theonly fresher from the department in attendance.
</p>
<p>
    I am bored in the hostel and i decide to clean the room with my playlist out loud. This guy who would go on to achieve great things as we go on this journey
    <a href="./Esosa.html">Esosa</a> interrupted
    humbly as he sang along to dancing queen playing from my phone.( That M11, Tueh!)
    <aside>as i write this Tuface don divorce african queen.Maybe she can become the dacing queen but she don pass 17.Thats btw sha</aside>
    He asked me if i knew more about the music group, ABBA. But as you will come to see soon enough, I don't really know anything
    about anyone. Hell! idek the size of my cock. I just listen to one or two  of your songs and could like you without going 
    to know other peculiar things about your art or background.
</p>
<p>
    A week after and begin attending lectures in the university. I must say looking back, i miss the general studies lectures with
    all freshers. I was asked by my HOD to get to know my senior colleagues and on that quest, i got to meet Adams, a 400 level colleague in the hostel.
    It was a lively interaction  after finding out we attended the same secondary school, only different years apart. While we spoke, i showed him an assignment i 
    had from lectures . He looked over me and called out "CSO" to one of the boys walking in the corridor. (It wont be the last 
    time you hear the infamous chief security officer anytime soon). They started laughing almost immediately at the glance of each other. When he came over, i was introduced
    as a fresher and he was <a href="./CSO.html">CSO</a>. He had a mature stature with a big belly and was a 200 level student in the same department.
    Adams said CSO would be in a poll position to help me out on the assignment while CSO denied the complemetary allegation, laughing, stating 
    that Adams was the guru in the mathematics courses of our discipline. This meeting would go on to help me establish a successful
    foundation in the department.
</p>
<p>
    Well, that was refreshing, I thought to myself as i walked down the corridor and back to my room. On getting to the room , i mention to the boys that there is also a CSO,
    a seller, of provisions other than Fundi who seems to have more in stock from the way he spoke to me. Immediately, 
    Ailrang asked me to  lead the way to this CSO and with the directions he had given me earlier, we set out to locate the not so 
    difficult coordinate within the ground floor of the hostel.
</p>
<p>
    Once there, it was obvious to see what all the fuss was about. Business was booming! There were people chatting, sitting on beds listening, others
    reaching out for gala, fanta , one item or another. We eventually picked what we wanted after answering curious questions of onlookers on my muscle size and 
    Ailrang's complexion.
    One curious onlooker stood out tho,a big talll guy. He was almost lost for words about the choice of school for 
    a foreign-looking Ailrang. Well,  we all know Ailrang , when he finally replies , you wouldnt doubt the accent and pidgin
    , that there is 100 percent Nigerian nigga behind the light skinned complexion. His name was <a href="./ADE.html">Ade</a>.  Ade was a roomate to CSO. For now, that 
    would tell you, we  would be crossing each other often.
    It wasn't obvious then but i should've guessed that he loved basketball. Well, how could i have noticed? There was
    no time hanging around when our bellies needed to be filled, i mean thats why we got there in the first place and we called
    it a night.
</p>
<p>
    I wake up one morning to the sound of metals clanging right outside our window. I go over to have a look at the cause of the rythmic clap 
    of metals and i am immediately facinated by what i see. The crowd of boys at the foot of the hostel, taking turns to benchpress
    round clamping irons and other equipment within the makeshift gym space out in the open.
    I could see Jordan,a fresher like myself at the center of it all. It was exciting to watch. After they were finished, as Jordan walked past my room on 
    the way to his, he stopped by to ask if i gym as he had noticed my physique to which i replied, "just pushups and more recently
    with Victor these past few days". Jordan was impressed and encouraged us to come join the gym sessions outside with the other guys.
